= Reverse2 =
 This project aims to produce SIDE data models from alfresco models,
 native models or custom ones including generated with SIDE.

== Configuration ==
 Copy xml file containing alfreco models in /Reverse2/src/models/<your folder>/
 Edit the build.properties files, and set model.dir to relative path from "/Reverse2/src/models/"
== Usage ==
 launch default ant target from this directory
 > ant
  
 reversed files can be found in /Reverse2/build/

== Limitations ==
=== constraints ===
 Reverse do not take account all properties constraints :
 only constraints using LENGTH, REGEX on properties are reversed.
 all constraints using @ref are skipped except for constraints generated by SIDE like *:nomenclature:mail

=== mandatory ===
 if mandatory is true, this is reversed but enforced attribute do not have equivalent in SIDE
 so generator always use same mandatory kind

=== index ===
 as mandatory some advanced configuration do not have equivalent in SIDE.
 if index = true, propertySearch key is set in SIDE property model, but :
 <atomic>,<stored> and <tokenised> are lost.
 Generator always use same values for <atomic>,<stored> and <tokenised>
