   ${symbol_pound}               log4j.logger.{fullClassName}={loglevel}
   ${symbol_pound}
   ${symbol_pound}      For example, to make 'com.example.MyExample' produce 'debug'
   ${symbol_pound}      logs, add a line like this:
   ${symbol_pound}   
   ${symbol_pound}               log4j.logger.com.example.MyExample=debug
