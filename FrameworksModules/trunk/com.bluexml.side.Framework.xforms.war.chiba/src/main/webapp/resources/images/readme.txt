BlueXML XForms

Icons are from the Crystal and Nuvola projects, both under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The icons are used on the following selection widgets:
- Nx1: unique selected item for associations. Uses left and right.
- Nx1: unique selected item for text fields. Uses select and clear.
- NxN: multiple selected items. Uses add, remove, up and down.

The clear2 and select2 icons are provided as possible replacements for clear and select respectively. As such, they are not used.

Any icon may be replaced by another icon, in which case the new icon must retain the old icon's file name. If not, the xforms.generated.css file will need to be amended with respect to the file name or the icon sizes.
